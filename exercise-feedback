Exercise 1 - Great job!

Exercise 2 - Your code looks good, but can you refactor to use conditional statements?

Exercise 3 - Can you explain lines 72, 73, and 80 in your code?

Exercise 4 and 5 look great!

Exercise 6 - In most cases, you wouldn't want to return an alert. A return statement returns a value from a function that can be stored by a variable and used in another part of the program. An alert is a statement that can be used to notify the user of something, and can be treated as its own JS statement.
